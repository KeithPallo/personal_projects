# Team Early Bird - Hackathon Project Overview


---

This repository contains all relevant information for Team Early Bird's
submission at the 2018 New York Developer Week Hackathon.

Team Early Bird was the winner of AppNexus' Sponsor Challenge at the event,
and was also selected as a top 5 overall team.

The project focused on building an application which would allow a user to tune
their own definition of malicious content. Using two types of malicious
advertisements that were provided in the challenge, our team successfully
trained and implemented two ML systems to detect malicious content - one based
on NLP text analysis and another based on Tensorflow Image classification. Our
team also detailed an action plan to use results from both systems which would
accomplish our overall object of allowing a user to create a definition
of malicious content based on selection of images. This method would be far
more accurate than selecting specific categories or terms laid out by
providers, which is one of the major advantages of machine learning. 


A great place to get a high level overview of the project is the presentation
pdf found in this repository.
